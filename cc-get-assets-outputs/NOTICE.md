# Notice of reuse

This directory contains source code that has been originally created by a third party, and has been incorporated into
this Blockchain of Things' project. Please notice that the code may have been changed to serve the specific needs of
the project.

The baseline of the source code in this directory has been spawn from commit `d7cab1e` of this public git [repository](https://github.com/Colored-Coins/cc-get-assets-outputs.git)
where the original third-party source code is maintained.

The following is the integral contents of the third-party source code's original README file.
